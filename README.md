This minecraft mod allows you to automate frequently performed actions.

When you press the Y button, the main menu of Modules for managing macros opens.
* Each module is separately turned on/off and configured.
* Each module can contain an unlimited number of macros.

For a macro you can configure: keybind, looping, activation delay, and action type.
Currently there are the following types of actions:
* Command - a message or command on behalf of the character in the chat.
* Player action - performing an action by the character as if the player were pressing a button. (walking, placing blocks, breaking blocks, etc.)

By default, 3 simple macros are created: calling the "Hello world" command, auto breaking and auto placing.

##
Macros are not cheats, but may be prohibited on some servers. Before using in multiplayer, please read the server rules.
